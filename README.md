This module provides a check suite, and a set of automated checks that can be run over a Silverstripe module
to determine a "quality rating".

This library can be installed into a Silverstripe 3 or 4 project that uses Composer.

## Installation

You can install this library with Composer if you want to use its public API:

```
composer require silverstripe/moduleratings
```

You can also install the [silverstripe/moduleratings-plugin](https://github.com/silverstripe/moduleratings-plugin)
Composer plugin, which will provide a Composer command you can run locally to check module quality ratings.
Please see the readme in that module for more information on using it.

## Requirements

* [symfony/finder](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/finder.html) 3 or 4
* [symfony/yaml](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/yaml.html) 3 or 4

**Note:** If you have conflicts with any of the symfony components (if using the Composer plugin)
during installation, you may need to manually require an older version of one or both of those packages, e.g.:

``` 
composer require symfony/yaml ~3.0
composer require symfony/console ~3.0
```

## Using the API

To create a check suite, use the `SilverStripe\ModuleRatings\CheckSuite` class. You will need to provide the
directory path to the module code you want to check, and optionally the GitHub repository slug for the
module (note: only GitHub supported at this stage). Providing the repository slug will enable checks that
look at external continuous integration system APIs to determine quality metrics (e.g. Travis, Scrutinizer).

```php
$checkSuite = new \SilverStripe\ModuleRatings\CheckSuite();

$checkSuite
    ->setModuleRoot('/path/to/silverstripe/framework')
    ->setRepositorySlug('silverstripe/silverstripe-framework');

$checkSuite->run();

echo 'Framework has scored ' . $checkSuite->getScore() . ' out of 100 points. Details:', PHP_EOL;
print_r($checkSuite->getCheckDetails());
```

The return data from `CheckSuite::getCheckDetails` is an array with the following example structure
(note that example is JSON encoded):

```json
{
  "good_code_coverage": {
    "description": "Has a \"good\" level of code coverage (greater than 40%, requires slug)",
    "points": 5,
    "maximum": 5
  },
  "has_code_of_conduct_file": {
    "description": "Has a code of conduct file",
    "points": 2,
    "maximum": 2
  },
  "coding_standards": {
    "description": "The PHP code in this module passes the Silverstripe lint rules (mostly PSR-2)",
    "points": 0,
    "maximum": 10
  }
 }
```

## Available checks

* "Good" code coverage (>= 40%) (via either Scrutinizer CI or Codecov.io)
* "Great" code coverage (>= 75%) (via either Scrutinizer CI or Codecov.io)
* PHP code is in either "code" or "src" folder
* PHP code passes a [PSR-2](www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/)-ish linting standards check (phpcs.xml.dist is stored in 
  `src/Check/CodingStandardCheck` for reference)
* Contributing guide file exists
* Has documentation
* [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) configuration file exists
* [.gitattributes](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes) file exists
* A license file exists
* The repository has a readme
* [Scrutinizer CI](https://scrutinizer-ci.com) is configured and has a "good" quality rating (>= 6.5/10)
* One of either [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) or [CircleCI](https://circieci.com) is configured and the last build
  passed successfully

The registered checks are defined in `config.yml` along with the number of points awarded for each check given that
it passes.

### Caveats

Please note the following caveats/gotchas/todos:

* Code repositories must exist on GitHub for external API checks to work

## Thanks!

A huge thank you to [Chris Pitt](https://github.com/assertchris) who originally wrote Helpful Robot, the
inspiration for this library.

The checks in this library are heavily inspired by the original Helpful Robot checks, and are designed to
match the [Silverstripe commercially supported module standard](https://www.silverstripe.org/software/addons/supported-modules-definition/).

Without Helpful Robot the Silverstripe community would look a lot less tidy today!
